# Lunardo Cinema

The website in question was developed using a combination of PHP, JavaScript, CSS, and a modest amount of HTML. Here's a more refined explanation of the project's progression:

Our journey in building this cinema website involved four main assignments:

###### Index Page Editing: 
Our initial task was to make edits to the index page as part of our first assignment.

###### Creating the Cinema Website: 
In our second assignment, we embarked on crafting the initial version of the cinema website. This stage primarily revolved around PHP and CSS for its development.

###### Implementing the Booking System: 
For the third assignment, we introduced JavaScript to empower the website with a robust booking system. Users could now select their preferred movie, specify the number of tickets, and view the associated pricing. Upon completion of the booking process, users were seamlessly redirected back to the landing page.

###### Ticket Retrieval and Booking History: 
The fourth and final assignment posed the challenge of enabling users to access their booked tickets, complete with pricing details and seating information. Additionally, we had to provide a feature for users to retrieve their booking history.

Throughout this journey, I encountered an issue with users' ability to access their booking information. This problem specifically pertained to compatibility with different web browsers. While the website performed smoothly on Firefox during testing, issues arose when using Chrome or other browsers. Buttons and forms failed to function correctly. This is an issue I intend to address in the future when time permits, to ensure cross-browser compatibility.
